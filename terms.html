				<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				The Scoutred website and services are provided by Scoutred, a California company ("Scoutred", "we" "us" or "our"). These Terms of Service (the "Terms of Service") govern your access to and use of the scoutred.com website (the "Website") and all services provided via the Website including without limitation our land use search (the "Services"). The term “you” or “your” shall refer to any person or entity that views, uses, accesses, browses or submits any content or material to the Website. Access to the Website, use of the Services, and purchase of any products is subject to these Terms of Service and the <a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a> available on the Website.
			</p>
			<h4>Acceptance of Terms</h4>
			<p>
				These Terms of Service apply to all Website visitors and users of the Website or Services and by visiting or using the Website, you agree to be bound by this Terms of Service. If you don't agree with any term or condition in these Terms of Service, please don't use the Website or any of the Services. 
			</p>
			<h4>Minors</h4>
			<p>
				The Services are available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and older who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Individuals under the age of 18 can use the Services only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. In this case, the adult is the user and is responsible for any and all activities, subscribers and purchasers.
			</p>
			<h4>Eligibility for Use</h4>
			<p>
				We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Services is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Services is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Services or any products conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. Further, the Services are offered only for your use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party.
			</p>
			<h4>Website Content</h4>
			<p>
				You have a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive right to access and use the Content of this Website subject to these Terms of Service. The term "Content" means all information, text, images, data, links, software, or other material accessible through the Website or the Services, whether created by us or provided by another person for display on the Website or through the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Content may contain typographical errors, other inadvertent errors or inaccuracies. We reserve the right to make changes to document names and content, descriptions or specifications of products or services, or other information without obligation to issue any notice of such changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nothing contained on this Website should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use this Website or any Content displayed on this Website, through the use of framing or otherwise, except: (a) as expressly permitted by these Terms of Service; or (b) with our prior written permission or the permission of such third party that may own the trademark or copyright of material displayed on this Website.
			</p>
			<h4>Registration and Membership</h4>
			<p>
				In order to start your ongoing Scoutred subscription, you must register as a member on our Website. To register you can simply provide the information required in our registration forms, which can be accessed through the Website. All information that you provide to us is subject to the <a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. You are responsible for keeping your registration information up to date.
			</p>
			<h4>Subscription Terms</h4>
			<p>
				As a subscribed Scoutred member, each month you will have access to land use and property data. The subscription terms are as described in the subscription and checkout pages of the Website. See our subscription page for a description of the current subscriptions and prices. Note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a paid subscription are deemed part of this Agreement.
			</p>
			<h4>Automatic Renewal; Subscription Cancellation Policy</h4>
			<p>
				As a subscribed Scoutred member, you acknowledge and consent to being charged a recurring payment and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to the cancellation of your membership. Your subscription will be automatically renewed for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription period originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You may cancel your ongoing membership by emailing your request to cancel to <a href="mailto:hello@scoutred.com">hello@scoutred.com</a>. The day of the month that you start your ongoing membership is your anniversary date. Each subscription automatically renews on the anniversary date of the month following the end of the previous subscription period. You must notify us by emailing your request to cancel to <a href="mailto:hello@scoutred.com">hello@scoutred.com</a> prior to the anniversary date of the month following the end of the previous subscription period to cancel your subscription. IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL PRIOR TO THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR RENEWING THE SUBSCRIPTION. All cancellation requests received after the anniversary date of the month following the end of the previous subscription period will apply to the following subscription month. No prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period will be given. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We may terminate your membership, without notice, for any reason, whatever.
			</p>
			<h4>Billing and Payments</h4>
			<p>
				All information that you provide to Scoutred, including your credit card information, is subject to the <a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you have a subscription, your credit card will automatically be charged by a third party payment service each month for your ongoing subscription. For all other purchases, your credit card will be charged by a third party payment service who will transfer and deliver the funds to us at the time of purchase. For your convenience and continuous subscription benefits as a member, if your payment method reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your credit card information or cancel your membership, you authorize us to continue billing that credit card on file including extending the expiration date until we are notified by you or the credit card company that the account is no longer valid. We encourage you to constantly update your payment method information or cancel your membership should you wish to discontinue your subscription. We are not responsible for any fees or charges your issuing bank or credit card provider may charge you. If your payment to us is returned for any reason, you authorize us to continue billing your credit card on file and seek payment by another method until payment is received.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use a third party payment service in lieu of directly processing your credit card information. By submitting your credit card information, you grant Scoutred the right to store and process your information with the third party payment service, which it may change from time to time, and you agree that Scoutred will not be responsible for any failures of the third party payment service to adequately protect such information. All financial matters regarding your information are subject to the conditions of the third party payment service provider's terms of service. You acknowledge that we may change the third party payment service and move your information to other service providers that encrypt your information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other comparable security technology.
			</p>
			<h4>Local Taxes</h4>
			<p>
				Your total price may include the price of any products plus any applicable sales tax; such state and local sales tax is based on the shipping address and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you purchase any products. 
			</p>

			<h4>Conduct on Website</h4>

				Your use of this Website is subject to all applicable laws and regulations and you are solely responsible for the contents of your communications through this Website. You shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, take any action or upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any Content on this Website, that:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Is unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another’s privacy, tortious, contains explicit or graphic descriptions or accounts of sexual acts (including but not limited to sexual language of a violent or threatening nature directed at another individual or group of individuals), or otherwise violates our rules or policies;

					</li>
					<li>
						Infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other proprietary right of any party;

						Impersonates any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h4>Jurisdictional Issues</h4>
			<p>
				We make no representation that information on this Website or the Services we provide are appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Those who choose to access this Website from outside the United States do so on their own initiative and at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
			</p>
			<h4>Termination</h4>
			<p>
				We may terminate any user's subscription or access to our Website or the Services, in our sole discretion, for any reason and at any time, with or without prior notice. It is our policy to terminate users who violate these Terms of Service, as deemed appropriate in our sole discretion. You agree that we are not liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to our Website or the Services.
			</p>
			<h4>Disputes</h4>
			<p>
				These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to, or use of, the Website, to the products or the Services you purchase through the Website (including a subscription), or to your relationship to Scoutred shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in San Diego, California; provided, however, that to the extent that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the State of California. You hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of California. Arbitration under these Terms of Service will be conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and may be entered into as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms of Service will be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Terms of Service, whether through class action proceedings or otherwise. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of this Website or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.
			</p>
			<p>
				ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.
			</p>
			<p>
				YOU AND SCOUTRED AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A 	PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Scoutred agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
			</p>
			<h4>Severability</h4>
			<p>	
				If any part of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
			</p>
			<h4>Entire Terms of Service</h4>
			<p>
				These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter herein. We may, at our sole discretion and without notice, revise these terms at any time by updating this posting.
			</p>
			<h4>Notice</h4>
			<p>
				Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notice required or permitted by this Terms of Service must be in writing. Any notice to Scoutred must be given by postal mail to Scoutred at 1043 6th Ave, San Diego CA 92101. Any notice to you may be given: (1) to the email address you provide to Scoutred during registration or when your email address changes, in which case notice will be deemed sufficient 24 hours after the email is sent unless the sending party is notified that the email address is invalid; or (2) by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the last mailing address you provided to Scoutred, in which case notice will be deemed sufficient three days after the mailing date.
			</p>
			<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
			<p>
				We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Service. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.
			</p>
			<h4>Modifications to Terms of Service</h4>
			<p>
				We may change these Terms of Service at any time for any reason by updating this posting. You are responsible for periodically reviewing these Terms of Service for revisions. Changes in these Terms of Service will be effective when posted. If Scoutred makes a material change, Scoutred will notify you here in these Terms of Service or by any other means we deem appropriate. Scoutred may determine, in its sole discretion, in good faith, what constitutes a "material change" using common sense and reasonable judgment. Your use of the Website after we have modified this posting will constitute your acceptance of any changes.
